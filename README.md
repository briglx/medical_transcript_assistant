# Medical Transcript Assistant

Example Project to demonstrate LLM to summarize medical exam transcription into a patient record

# Getting Started

Configure the environment variables. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and update the values

Run project locally
```bash
# load .env vars (optional)
[ -f .env ] && while IFS= read -r line; do [[ $line =~ ^[^#]*= ]] && eval "export $line"; done < .env

# Create and activate a python virtual environment
# virtualenv \path\to\.venv -p path\to\specific_version_python.exe
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python main.py
```

# Development

You'll need to set up a development environment if you want to develop a new feature or fix issues. The project uses a docker based devcontainer to ensure a consistent development environment.

- Open the project in VSCode and it will prompt you to open the project in a devcontainer. This will have all the required tools installed and configured.

## Setup local dev environment

If you want to develop outside of a docker devcontainer you can use the following commands to setup your environment.

```bash
# load .env vars (optional)
[ -f .env ] && while IFS= read -r line; do [[ $line =~ ^[^#]*= ]] && eval "export $line"; done < .env

# Create and activate a python virtual environment
# virtualenv \path\to\.venv -p path\to\specific_version_python.exe
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# deactivate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pre-commit install
```


## Style Guidelines

This project enforces quite strict [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257 (Docstring Conventions)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) compliance on all code submitted.

We use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code formatting.

Summary of the most relevant points:

- Comments should be full sentences and end with a period.
- [Imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports) should be ordered.
- Constants and the content of lists and dictionaries should be in alphabetical order.
- It is advisable to adjust IDE or editor settings to match those requirements.

### Use new style string formatting

Prefer [`f-strings`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) over `%` or `str.format`.

```python
# New
f"{some_value} {some_other_value}"
# Old, wrong
"{} {}".format("New", "style")
"%s %s" % ("Old", "style")
```

One exception is for logging which uses the percentage formatting. This is to avoid formatting the log message when it is suppressed.

```python
_LOGGER.info("Can't connect to the webservice %s at %s", string1, string2)
```

### Testing

Ideally, all code is checked to verify the following:

All the unit tests pass All code passes the checks from the linting tools To run the linters, run the following commands:

```bash
# Use pre-commit scripts to run all linting
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific linter via pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files codespell

# Run linters outside of pre-commit
codespell .
```
