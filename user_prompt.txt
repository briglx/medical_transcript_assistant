Doctor: Hi Henry, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hey Doc. I've got this rash that showed up on my arm.
Doctor: How long have you had it?
Patient: Started like two days ago, just a little red spot at first, but now it's spread and it's really itchy. Sometimes it kind of stings.
Doctor: Any new soaps, detergents, or lotions you've been using?
Patient: Nope, nothing new. But I did go hiking last weekend and got into some brush and stuff.
Doctor: Got it. Did you try anything to treat it?
Patient: Yeah, I had some cortisone cream, but it didn't help much.
Doctor: Have you noticed any breathing issues since you mentioned hiking?
Patient: Actually yeah. I've been using my inhaler more than usual since then, but I'm okay now. No wheezing right now.
Doctor: Alright. Let's take a look at the rash. [pause] Looks like contact dermatitis on medial aspect of right forearm, approx. 8x6 cm, no drainage or vesicles, with excoriations; erythematous and warm to touch.
Patient: Is it serious?
Doctor: It doesn't look infected, so that's good. I'll prescribe a stronger topical steroid and have you avoid irritants. If it doesn't get better in a week or gets worse, come back.
Patient: Sounds good.
Doctor: And keep using your inhaler as needed. Make sure you've got enough at home.
Patient: Will do. Thanks.
