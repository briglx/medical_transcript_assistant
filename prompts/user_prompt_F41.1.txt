Provider: I'm sorry to hear that. Any panic attacks or thoughts of hurting yourself?
Patient: No, nothing like that. Just can't shut my brain off.
Provider: Have you tried anything to manage it? Breathing, therapy, medications?
Patient: I've tried some apps, but not much else.
Provider: We can start with counseling and consider a low-dose prescription for an SSRI medication to help stabilize your mood and sleep. Many people find that helpful, especially when sleep is affected. Let's check in again in 4 weeks.
Patient: That would be great. I just want to feel normal again.
