User Prompt
=========================
Provider: Hey John, I see you've got a spot you're worried about.
Patient: Yeah, I've had this mole on my shoulder for a while, but it's been changing color and shape.
Provider: Let me take a look... Hmm. It's asymmetric, has some irregular borders, and the color is uneven.
Patient: That's not good, right?
Provider: It's suspicious enough that I'd like to do a biopsy to rule out melanoma. We'll send it to pathology.
Patient: Okay, let's do it.
Provider: I'll numb the area and take a small sample. Results usually come back in a few days.
Patient: Thanks for catching this early.
