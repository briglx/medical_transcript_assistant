First, can I verify your contact info and pharmacy?\nPatient: Yes, nothing's changed.\nProvider: Any allergies?\nPatient: None that I know of.\nProvider: Any recent weight loss, fevers, or fatigue?\nPatient: No, I feel fine.\nProvider: Good. Any history of skin cancer in the family?\nPatient: My dad had melanoma.\nProvider: That's helpful. Let's take a look at the mole.\nPatient: Yeah, I've had this mole on my shoulder for a while, but it's been changing color and shape.\nProvider: Let me take a look... Hmm. It's asymmetric, has some irregular borders, and the color is uneven, about 7mm on the left shoulder near the top of the shoulder blade.\nPatient: That's not good, right?\nProvider: It's suspicious enough that I'd like to do a biopsy to rule out melanoma. We'll send it to pathology.\nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\nProvider: Let me check your lymph nodes. no swelling. Skin elsewhere looks clear.\nPatient: Thanks for being thorough.\nProvider: Of course. We'll numb the area and get the results back in a few days.\nPatient: Thanks for catching this early.\n",
