    "user_prompt": "Provider: Hey Travis, what happened to your back?\nPatient: I lifted a box helping my neighbor move. Felt a pop, and now it's sore and stiff.\nProvider: Any numbness or tingling down your legs?\nPatient: Nope, just pain in my lower back. Hurts when I bend.\nProvider: Sounds musculoskeletal. Let's check your range of motion and see if we need imaging.\nPatient: I'd rather not do an MRI unless it's serious.\nProvider: Totally reasonable. I'll recommend heat, rest, and anti-inflammatories. If it doesn't improve in 7-10 days, we'll reassess.\nPatient: Got it, thanks.\n",
