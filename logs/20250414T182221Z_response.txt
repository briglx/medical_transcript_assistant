User Prompt
=========================
Doctor: Hi Henry, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hey Doc. I've got this rash that showed up on my arm.
Doctor: How long have you had it?
Patient: Started like two days ago, just a little red spot at first, but now it's spread and it's really itchy. Sometimes it kind of stings.
Doctor: Any new soaps, detergents, or lotions you've been using?
Patient: Nope, nothing new. But I did go hiking last weekend and got into some brush and stuff.
Doctor: Got it. Did you try anything to treat it?
Patient: Yeah, I had some cortisone cream, but it didn't help much.
Doctor: Have you noticed any breathing issues since you mentioned hiking?
Patient: Actually yeah. I've been using my inhaler more than usual since then, but I'm okay now. No wheezing right now.
Doctor: Alright. Let's take a look at the rash. [pause] Looks like contact dermatitis on medial aspect of right forearm, approx. 8x6 cm, no drainage or vesicles, with excoriations; erythematous and warm to touch.
Patient: Is it serious?
Doctor: It doesn't look infected, so that's good. I'll prescribe a stronger topical steroid and have you avoid irritants. If it doesn't get better in a week or gets worse, come back.
Patient: Sounds good.
Doctor: And keep using your inhaler as needed. Make sure you've got enough at home.
Patient: Will do. Thanks.

    - ID: Not discussed
    - DOB: Not discussed

- Appointment Reason: Rash on arm

- Allergies: Not discussed

- History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a rash on his arm that started two days ago initially as a red spot, then spread and became itchy and slightly painful. No change in soap, detergent, or lotion use, but mentioned exposure to brush during a recent hiking trip. Attempted self-treatment with cortisone cream without relief. Reports increased use of pre-existing inhaler since hike, implying possible respiratory allergies or asthma, but no current breathing difficulties.

- Review of Systems (ROS): Skin - positive for rash and itchiness. Respiratory - shortness of breath, managed with inhaler.

- Physical Exam: Rash (contact dermatitis) identified on medial aspect of right forearm. Approximately 8x6cm with excoriations. No drainage or vesicles present. Erythema and warmth noted.

- Assessment and Plan:
    1. Contact Dermatitis: Advised patient to continue avoiding irritants. Prescribed a stronger topical steroid for the rash. Instructed patient to return if condition worsens or doesn't improve after one week.
    2. Potential Environmental-triggered breathing issue: Advised patient to continue using his inhaler as needed.

- Medications: Cortisone cream (for rash), Inhaler (presumably for breathing issues), New prescription for stronger topical steroid (for rash)

- Note: Further details needed for a comprehensive clinical note, including the patient's past medical history, social history, family history, and a more complete review of the systems.
