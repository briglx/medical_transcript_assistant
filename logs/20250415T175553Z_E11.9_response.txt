User Prompt
=========================
Provider: Good morning, Maria. How have you been managing your blood sugars lately?
Patient: Morning, Doc. They're still a little high in the mornings. I'm trying to stick to the plan, but it's hard with work.
Provider: Are you still taking the metformin twice a day?
Patient: I am, but I missed a few doses last week.
Provider: Understood. Any new symptoms like numbness, vision changes, unusual thirst?
Patient: No new symptoms. I've been feeling tired, though.
Provider: Let's do a quick check on your A1C today, and I'll also review your medication routine. We may want to adjust your diet or consider a second medication if needed.
Patient: Okay, I'm open to that.

  1. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus: Maria is still reporting high fasting blood sugars. We will check her glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) to get a better view of her overall glucose control.
  2. Fatigue: This is often a symptom of high blood sugars. After evaluating her blood glucose control, further investigation may be needed if symptom persists.
  3. Non-adherence to medication regimen: Maria missed few doses of her metformin last week. Reinforce the importance of medication adherence and discuss potential modifications of medication regimen to improve control, including the possible addition of a second medication if required.
  4. Lifestyle & diet modification: Re-evaluation and potential modification of her diet could help improve her blood glucose control.

- Medications
