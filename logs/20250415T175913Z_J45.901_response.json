    "user_prompt": "Provider: Hi Jamal, I see you came in after last week's dust storm. What's going on?\nPatient: Yeah, my chest got really tight. I had to use my rescue inhaler like four times in one day.\nProvider: Did you have any wheezing or trouble catching your breath?\nPatient: Both. It calmed down after a few hours, but it scared me.\nProvider: Any ER visits or hospital stays?\nPatient: No, I just waited it out.\nProvider: You did the right thing using the inhaler, but we need to talk about adding a controller medication, especially during monsoon season.\nPatient: That makes sense. I hate feeling like that.\n",
