User Prompt
=========================
Provider: Hey Travis, what happened to your back?
Patient: I lifted a box helping my neighbor move. Felt a pop, and now it's sore and stiff.
Provider: Any numbness or tingling down your legs?
Patient: Nope, just pain in my lower back. Hurts when I bend.
Provider: Sounds musculoskeletal. Let's check your range of motion and see if we need imaging.
Patient: I'd rather not do an MRI unless it's serious.
Provider: Totally reasonable. I'll recommend heat, rest, and anti-inflammatories. If it doesn't improve in 7-10 days, we'll reassess.
Patient: Got it, thanks.
