    "user_prompt": "Doctor: Hi Henry, what brings you in today?\nPatient: Hey Doc. I\u2019ve got this rash that showed up on my arm.\nDoctor: How long have you had it?\nPatient: Started like two days ago, just a little red spot at first, but now it\u2019s spread and it's really itchy. Sometimes it kind of stings.\nDoctor: Any new soaps, detergents, or lotions you\u2019ve been using?\nPatient: Nope, nothing new. But I did go hiking last weekend and got into some brush and stuff.\nDoctor: Got it. Did you try anything to treat it?\nPatient: Yeah, I had some cortisone cream, but it didn\u2019t help much.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any breathing issues since you mentioned hiking?\nPatient: Actually yeah. I\u2019ve been using my inhaler more than usual since then, but I\u2019m okay now. No wheezing right now.\nDoctor: Alright. Let\u2019s take a look at the rash. [pause] Looks like contact dermatitis on medial aspect of right forearm, approx. 8x6 cm, no drainage or vesicles, with excoriations; erythematous and warm to touch.\nPatient: Is it serious?\nDoctor: It doesn\u2019t look infected, so that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll prescribe a stronger topical steroid and have you avoid irritants. If it doesn\u2019t get better in a week or gets worse, come back.\nPatient: Sounds good.\nDoctor: And keep using your inhaler as needed. Make sure you\u2019ve got enough at home.\nPatient: Will do. Thanks.\n",
